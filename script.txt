Act I
Setting: at landlord’s home
Landlord: There are three tasks today: one is chopping wood, and ……
Farmer: I choose that !!! I am gonna to chop wood.
Landlord (laugh loudly): OK, we just need more guys like you ! Let’s go on then:  other tasks are carrying water and grazing.
Son (unhappy): Dad, why you choose so quickly? You can definitely wait for him finishing his speaking and it is not late to make a decision at that time.
Farmer: No, son, you are completely wrong ! If I don’t decide quickly, I may not even be able to chop wood in the end.
Son: But in fact, chopping wood is the most difficult task compared to the rest of tasks !
Farmer: Well, at the very start, you don’t know what the next task is. Maybe easier, maybe harder. So if I don’t choose first, there may be more difficult tasks waiting for me.
Son: But this time you failed, right?
Farmer: Obviously, fortune will not always stand by your side. But I think this way of thinking is right.
Son: OK, I know what you means.

Act II
Setting: near the river
voice-over: The farmer and his son went on the way to chop wood.When they were chopping, suddenly, the axe flew into the river.
farmer: Oh, damn. Let’s go to the riverside!(angry and unbelievable)
Son: Dad, I hear some voice came from the river.(surprised)
God: Who dares to throw things everywhere and disturbs my nap?(impatient)
Farmer: Oh, god! It’s all my fault. I dropped the axe when I chopped wood. I feel so sorry for bothering you. God bless me, please give back my axe.(terrified)
God: Which one is yours? Gold or silver?
Farmer: Actually, I ……
(the son take the farmer aside)
Son: Dad, it is a rare opportunity for us to make a fortune !
Farmer said to his son: Neither of them are mine. Mine is iron. I must tell the god.
Son: Why? Why not choose the other ones? The iron one has no value.
Farmer: How can I lie to the god? It’s totally a wrong decision.

(standard ending -simplified edition)
Son: Dad, you see. The golden axe can help us get rid of the landlord’s control. We will be rich. We can do anything we want. We can even be the landlord. Don’t hesitate, come on, daddy, just do it!
Farmer: I can’t make this stupid decision. Only right choice can give me no burden.
(farmer turn around)
Farmer: Dear God, I dropped an iron axe.
God: Wow! I will bless you guys. You do honest decision. I will reward you both the gold and silver axe.

If someone stopped to choose the gold axe. God could do anything to punish him.
Maybe no one will choose silver axe I guess.
